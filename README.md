# CaSILE Template

This a **template** repository for starting new [CaSILE](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/casile) based projects.
It is designed to be as minimal as possible to get get you started.

1. Start a new project with ["Use this template"](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/casile-template/generate) ([docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)). Alternatively if not using GitHub, clone this repository yourself or download and extract the [ZIP file](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/casile-template/archive/master.zip) then `git init` your own repository.
2. Remove (or rewrite) this `README.md` file and update the `LICENSE` file to suit your project.
3. Rename the files `my_book.md` and `my_book.yml` to a name suitable to your project.
4. Update the values in `casile.mk` to suit your project.

See the [CaSILE Demos repository](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/casile-demos) for more advanced usage working examples.
